      Ditch the desk job, get out and explore!

      Unplug and disconnect from the digital world. Come enjoy the endless amount of entertainment that nature has to offer. Some of the Earth's greatest landscapes are threatened by increased population, construction, oil and gas exploration, and mining. We aim to educate our youth to help protect these areas from inappropriate development and take time to enjoy the great outdoors. We cannot protect these environments alone and our youth deserves the opportunity to experience these undeveloped places. Come join us in our fight for adventure. Find out how you can help.
